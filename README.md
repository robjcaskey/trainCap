trainCap
========

experimental DCC train control web interface

the idea is that once complete, take a standard raspberry pi running raspian and run

wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robjcaskey/trainCap/master/bootstrap.sh | bash

then visit the address it spits out on your iphone or android
